I said hi to you in passing,
On a day in the dead of summer,
Record it by the sweat I wore
Remembered by the heatwave's strokes.

You said hi back, a sleight of tongue?
Is this a lapse in judgement spied?
I said hi, and then hello again,
You said it back and I knew then.

That my friend was dead.

Hello, orphan,
Hello again.
