When your words fall short,
You gotta learn to resort to bolt action,
Coz we're using ferrous rounds but,
Spark a diamagnetic dis-attraction.

"Would you have spent the night with me,
If I was short an amine group?
You don't have to lie to me.
You know that I can take the truth".

I lied but wore a good-faith smile,
And told her what she needs to hear,
*"If you got rid of the chemistry,
You know you wouldn't find me here".*
