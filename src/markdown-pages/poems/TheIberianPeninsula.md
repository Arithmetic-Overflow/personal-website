The Iberian Peninsula: What The Fuck Were You Thinking With That Age Gap
(She Normalized It For Me?)

From Amber's Perspective:
"The less you speak the more you write,
But the less you write the less you speak,
If I didn't know any better, I'd say by
1994 I would have fucking peaked.

So watch the news, and ink your beak,
I'll write to you, and you'll respond,
So please write back if wat you write,
And what you miss just might belong.

Though in my head, it's obvious,
We'll weather stormy skies,
Been doing it since '94 and
The only cause is lacked goodbyes.

And I won't even think amuse
The chance that he might never mail,
And I need time to think it through,
So we'll talk to match speed of snails.

I never asked for her ID,
And when I saw I had played pretend,
That it was something that I'd never seen.
But you were younger, and I'm content.

And if the way you thought of me,
Was the slightest indication to
The love or lust that she had breathed.
Then that's enough, and I'd be through"

From My Perspective:
None of us have a leg to stand on,
But you had eight years more.
And she had three. You never
Grew up, and she had never breathed.

She's seventeen, and never saw
The gap in age. Just old enough
For play-pretend to falsely think
It sundered from her play-belief.

I don't know, won't say posthaste
How I feel post-fact and as of late.
I will come and I will leaves the haste,
Before it comes and grows till hate.

My feelings scatter and undulate,
It tears the line between okay
And not okay. It's not okay.
It's not okay. It's not okay.
