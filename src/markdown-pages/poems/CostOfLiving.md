There was something in her voice
When it washed over me,
My ears would stop,
And filter out the noise.

It'd been a while since I'd been by,
And I can't say that I'm happy,
But I can say that I'm proud.

There was something in eyes
When it locked with mine,
That killed me slow,
But it made me feel alive.

And I wanna live,
don't just want to
only survive.
