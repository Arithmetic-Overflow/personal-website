I had a nightmare in a dream
That evergreen became a tree,
and grew to shelter me.

Oh she's not all she seems,
But long lost are these
remnants of my dreams.

Of all the trees I saw,
None bloomed in spring to
stay through fall.

And if autumn comes to steal your shade,
I won't mourn your leaves,
My debt's been paid.

Though I might have come to
grieve your loss when it'd been barely
fucking way too long.

And I might come to miss you here,
Your reminders and your memories,
That dissolved in passing years.

Though I'll forget your friends,
Their sharp remarks that make me bleed,
That made you cut and pierce.

I didn't try to grow these lungs,
Just to drown upon the ground
Where my gills can't meet my tongue.

I'm here

And I'll hold onto the autumn dear,
Dread the summer heat so far from here.

But I won't fix your clock.
I forgot to buy the screws.

And that forms a single final block,
A final popping fuse.

The first one was your mum,
Who's trapped in time, and chugging rum,
If I had never caught him cheat
I'd dodge these exothermic fights,

They buried me in the heat.

And I won't frame your shot,
Coz the shooting's what I dread right now,
We'll keep the film and fall back on
The blurry pictures in our heads.

But I won't blame you this last time,
Like I couldn't blame you then,
With retrograde amnesia,
I lived retroactive day.

I can't seem to fight a corpse,
How fruitful it may seem.

The only thing thats left of here is a
nightmare and a dream.
