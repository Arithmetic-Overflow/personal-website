The Pirate Caught Me Curbing: Pretty Faes Mid-Sprint And Awake

I'll mark my path
And then I'll hound,
I'll snake the words
When they are found.

Think of words I waste
But seldom breathe, then
Bleed the whiskey's taste
Till it secedes.

There's a thousand things
I shouldn't say,
And even more
I shouldn't think.

But I'm treading ground
And marking seas,
On broken boats
That slowly sink.

And if you find
My dying light:
Just bid farewell
Please say goodnight.

We'll slowly sink,
We're at the edge,
So come and teeter
Out from this ledge.

We'll slowly sink
Down waterfalls,
As this planeship of a boat,
Begins to throttle and to stall.
