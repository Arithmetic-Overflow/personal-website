I Wouldn't Recommend Infidelity, Especially If It's Her Doing It

"If you kill me I won't call it murder,
It'd just be self-relief".

If I kill you I would call it blood-lust,
But not one that I would grieve.

"You have flayed me but don't you stay me,
I've got less than room for two".

If I knew what I had done then,
You'd say that wasn't true.
